# Design Guideline

Design `og:image` guidelines to our generator:
-  **Facebook**: 1200 x 630 pixels (_minimum 600 x 315 pixels_)
-  **Twitter**: 1200 x 675 pixels (_minimum 600 x 335 pixels_)
-  **LinkedIn**: 1200 x 628 pixels (_minimum 600 x 400 pixels_)

## Title Characters Length
Maximum title characters length is **42 characters** if the title exceeds this length, it may be truncated.

## Facebook (Recomended Size)
![Facebook (Recomended Size)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32319439/225009851-2995ddf4-574a-4427-9a4f-ec8f6dcac165.png)

The aspect ratio between 1200 x 630 pixels and 600 x 315 pixels is the same. Both image sizes have an aspect ratio of 1.91:1.

To calculate the aspect ratio of an image, you simply divide the width by the height.
1. For the 1200 x 630 pixel image, the aspect ratio is 1200/630 = 1.91:1. 
2. Similarly, for the 600 x 315 pixel image, the aspect ratio is 600/315 = 1.91:1.
